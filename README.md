# Assignment 1

The repository is part of the delivery in the first assignment related to the course TDT4250 Advanced Software Design at NTNU. The purpose of the assingment is to learn modelling with EMF and Ecore.

## Content

The two most significant folders are the **_model_** and **_src_** folders.

### Model

The model folder contains the initial models related to the project:

- **_studyplan.ecore_** is the Ecore model where classes and other structures has been defined according to the Ecore format.
- **_studyplan.genmodel_** is the generator model, which is a dynamic extension of the Ecore model, used to generate Java code which conform to the structure set in the mentioned model.
- **_Studyplan.xmi_** is a dynamic instance of the model, with the ECLass **Studyplan** as its root resource.

### Src - TODO

The source folder contains the generated code based on the Ecore model.

## Technical approach

This section covers how most of the features in the task specification and in use of EMF is handled in the delivery.

- **Constraints**: TODO
- **Derived features**: TODO
- **Operations**: TODO
- **DataTypes**: Only CourseCode. Considered Credits, but covered this as a constraint instead. Did not see enough profit by changing it.
- **TODO**

## Work flow

By looking at commit history, it is possible to get a view of how the work flow has been related to the assignment.
